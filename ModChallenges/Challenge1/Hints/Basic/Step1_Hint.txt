1. Custom projectiles do not need to have their own intense AI! You could always reuse pre-existing AI's such as the arrow AI.


2. Unlike projectiles and items, buffs don't have a SetDefaults() method. Changes to the player or NPCs need to be applied every frame.
   Where can we **update** values every frame?

3. Weapons need to be craftable, how can we add a recipe for the weapon?



Remember, tModLoader's example mod and their documentation is your friend!
