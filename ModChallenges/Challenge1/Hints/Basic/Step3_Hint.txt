1. We need the projectile to apply a buff when it hits an NPC. Is there a function we can call when the projectile hits something?

2. AddBuff() is a function that exists for Player and NPC objects!

3. Terraria plays in 60 ticks per second, be careful not to set the buff to something absurdly short or long!
