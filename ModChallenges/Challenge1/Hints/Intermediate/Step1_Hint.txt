1. One shot every 2 swings means 1 in every 2. A flip-flopping boolean is true once every 2 changes.

2. While there is a method in the ModItem class that can check if an item can shoot, it does this multiple
   times per item usage (I think). Instead of using CanShoot(), can we modify Shoot() directly?
