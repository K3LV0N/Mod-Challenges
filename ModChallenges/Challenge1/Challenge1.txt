Welcome to challenge 1 of my mod challenges!

In this challenge we will be teaching the basics of modding. 

This challenge at the basic level includes:
	- A Weapon
	- A projectile
	- A buff

If you would like to expand on this challenge, try your hand at the intermediate and advanced versions of the challenge after
completing the basic challenge!


Challenge 1: Getting aquainted with modding


Basic Challenge Requirements:

Step 1: Creating Objects:

	- Make a custom weapon: Make a regular melee sword. The starter sword generated from tModLoader is a good starting place.

	- Make a custom projectile: The stats can be anything you want.

	- Make a custom buff: The buff can do anything you want. Make sure it effects NPCs.


Step 2: Shooting Projectiles:

	- Make your sword shoot your custom projectile


Step 3: Projectile Inflicted Buffs:
	
	- Make your projectile inflict your buff


Result:

You should now have a sword that shoots a buff / debuff inflicting projectile. While this is basic, I am sure that this helps
open up possibilities for different weapons or items you could make.




Intermediate Challenge 

Step 1: Changing shooting frequency:

	- Find a way to make your sword only shoot a projectile every 2 swings.


Step 2: Right Click functionality:

	- Make your sword apply the buff to you when right clicking it **WHEN HOLDING IT IN YOUR HAND**


Result: Your sword should now shoot once every 2 shots and you can now apply the buff you made to yourself!




Advanced Challenge

Step 1: Time-Changing Stats:

	-Find a way to make your sword increase in damage at a rate of 1 damage per second up to a maximum of 8 more damage than the
	 sword's base damage.


Result: Someone that understands a decent amount about modding items :)
