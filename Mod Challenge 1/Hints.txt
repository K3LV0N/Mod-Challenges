Requirement hints:

-A custom projectile does not need to have it's own super custom AI!

-Buffs don't have setdefaults, where do we apply changes in the buff class?

-How can we make a recipe for the weapon?


Above and beyone hints:

-How can we modify when the weapon CANSHOOT a projectile?

-Maybe there is a function and variable we can use to check if a right click has been used?


INTENSE:

-Update gets called every frame, how can we use this to our advantage?
