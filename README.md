# 🎮 Welcome to My Terraria Mod Challenges!

This repository is a collection of hands-on **Terraria modding challenges** built using the **tModLoader API**.  
They’re designed to teach new modders the core capabilities of the API through fun, guided, and progressively complex mini-projects.

## 🚀 How It Works

Each challenge introduces new mechanics, features, and modding concepts.  
They are meant to be completed **in order**, as later challenges build on knowledge gained in earlier ones.

That said — if you’re already familiar with the basics or feeling confident —  
you’re welcome to **jump in wherever you'd like**! Each challenge folder includes the previous solution so you can pick up from there.

Happy modding!!! 🔧🌟
