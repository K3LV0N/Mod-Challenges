# Welcome to my mod challenges!!!

This repository contains some terraria modding challenges that utilize the tModLoader API designed
to teach new modders how some of the capabilities of the tModLoader API with a hands-on semi-directed
teaching experience!

Mod challenges should be completed in order from first to last as they build off each other and typically require
the knowledge learned in the previous challenge in order to be completed.

However, if you are confident then you can always grab the previous challenge's solution and start whereever you want!
